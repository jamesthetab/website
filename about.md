For the past several years, I have been working as a maths teacher and manager in schools, but this has been more the result of circumstance rather than long-term planning. Five years ago, I relocated to Yorkshire to support my parents through a health crisis. I took a teaching job at a boarding school nearby where I taught maths and served as Deputy Housemaster. I spent term breaks in Cambridge working with my supervisor and continued progressing on my research.

With that behind me now, I have returned to Cambridge to finish my PhD. I am now exploring opportunities that can make good use of my training - in pure mathematics, data science, applied analysis, and education.
