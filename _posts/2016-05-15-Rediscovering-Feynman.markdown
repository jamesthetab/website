I was looking up some of Feynman’s lectures on physics to help provide an introduction on gravitation to guide a student with their IB Extended Essay when I rediscovered a beautiful (non-technical) talk Feynman gave towards the end of his career on the pleasure of finding things out. A fine way to spend 50 minutes!

If you haven’t seen this [video](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x24gwgc_richard-feynman-the-pleasure-of-finding-things-out_news) before it is a fine way to spend 50 minutes.
