In this tutorial I look at how a relatively simple concept of whether a number is ["happy"](https://github.com/jamesthetab/iBeacon/blob/master/HappyCode.ipynb) (does it reach 1 eventually after repeatedly replacing the number by the sum of the squares of its digits) can lead to interesting behaviour which can only be described asymptotically.
