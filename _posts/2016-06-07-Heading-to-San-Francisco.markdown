I was very excited to find out a few weeks ago that I had won a scholarship to attend Apple's developers' conference in June, [WWDC](https://developer.apple.com). The last few years have been very inward looking while I have been finishing up my PhD research and teaching, and the opportunity to ask "What's really possible with all this cool tech?" is refreshing. 

As I've tried to get up to speed I've taken an exciting tour through Swift, Jekyll, R, SQL, and d3, as well as reconnecting with old friends Python, GitHub, Project Jupyter, Markdown, and LaTex.

As I've begun the transition from Education/Academy to the world of Tech and Business I am shocked by the speed at which things happen, and excited by all the opportunites this churn represents.
