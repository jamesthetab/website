I am using `Jekyll` for the first time to provide the scaffolding for a website hosted on 'GitHub'. The terminal interface is very powerful for this work and I have enjoyed learning about how to make new blog posts.

As someone who shares snippet of code I was pleased to learn that `Jekyll` also offers support for code snippets, highlighting to make the commands easy to read:

{% highlight python %}
i = 0
sum = 0

while i <= 10:
    sum = sum + i**2
    i = i + 1
    
print sum

#=> prints '385' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

As much for myself as anyone, here's a link to [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll.
