Over the next few weeks I will be sharing a series of interesting mathematical topics, made accessible to VIth formers, and augmented with code, hyperlinks, and diagrams. Based on mathematical Blogs, the Euler Project coding challenges, and the first year of the Cambridge undergraduate Tripos.

We start with [Bézout's Theorem](https://github.com/jamesthetab/iBeacon/blob/master/Thm1.ipynb)
