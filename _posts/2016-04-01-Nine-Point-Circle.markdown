Inspired by a sketch I came across on the dust cover of an old maths textbook I look in this video at the [Nine Point Circle](https://locly.com/api/card/25f6c4a9342a26e157b8e365a60df4e9/asset/video.m4v), also known as Feuerbach's Circle, and then I share the dynamic geometry, `GeoGebra` [applet](https://www.geogebra.org/m/XAdMakbR?doneurl=%2Fjamesthetab).
