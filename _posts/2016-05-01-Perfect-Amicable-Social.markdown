In a series of `Project:Jupyter` pages I explore the relationships between numbers when we repeatedly replace a number with the sum of its proper factors - a number may move on never to reurn; number may map to itself in which case it is called [Perfect](https://github.com/jamesthetab/iBeacon/blob/master/perfect.ipynb); it may osciallte between two values when we have an [Amicable] pair; or more generally it may go round and round a [Social](https://github.com/jamesthetab/iBeacon/blob/master/social.ipynb) loop.
